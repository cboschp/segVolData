# Bounding boxes used

These are the bounding boxes that appear in the different training and test datasets.

`[x,y,z]` refer to the coordinates of the top-leftmost vertex of each bounding box.
`[w,h,d]` refer to the width, height and depth of each bounding box.
 
Units are in voxels.

This means that if w = 500, and voxel size = 100nm, then bounding box width = 50000 nm = 50 µm.
 
The tables also contain the name of the histological layer associated to each bounding box (e.g. ‘external plexiform layer’), and its commonly used acronym (‘EPL’).

Each bounding box also has an individual identifier, unique within that dataset, that can incorporate the acronym of the histological layer when relevant.
